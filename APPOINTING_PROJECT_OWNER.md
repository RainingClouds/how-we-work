# Appointing Project Owner

Project owner is necessarily someone who has a fair understanding of technology but who is not involved in coding. **You can say, He is the one who can talk business in assembly code.** 

He is usually the person who is involved in the project since the enquiry phase. So he has all the information and background understanding about the client and the project.
