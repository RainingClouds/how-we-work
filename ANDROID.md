# Android / iOS
We only work on native Android and iOS applications.
**We strictly say no to HTML5 based or hybrid mobile applications.** 

**Why not hybrid/html5 apps ?**

When we go for these type of mobile application development, we are losing out on native experience, a chunk of native API accesses, and ofcourse performance. And we are not going with what others are saying, But before taking this decision we have tried a couple of demo applications in PhoneGap, Appcelerator. These are good when we are creating very simple applications without leveraging any advanced features of the platform.
