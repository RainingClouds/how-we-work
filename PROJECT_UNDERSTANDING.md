# Product Understanding Sprint
It's a critical step to get a clear understanding about the product. This is the time when we are in clients shoes and trying to grasp all the possible thoughts, ideas about the product. The timespan of the sprint would be maximum 5 days.

We divide the sprint into two stages:
1. Client's Product Pitch
2. User's View

#Client's Product Pitch

We ask our clients to pitch the product to us same like you do with Investors. We involve all the major stakeholders in the conversation and keep video recording of same.

Primary questions that we ponder on:
1.  What’s the Problem your are trying to solve?
2.  What’s the Solution you are trying to propose?
3.  What are people forced to do now because what you plan to make doesn't exist yet?
4.  What are the other solution providers who are solving the same the problem? ( USP, Launch date) 
5.  What do you understand about the Problem that other companies / solutions in it just don't get?
6. Who is Ideal customer for your solution?

Goal of the stage:
1. Understanding the problem and the vision about the product.
2. Understand the logical belief behind the offered solution via product.
3. Detailed view on target customer person.

Activities
1. Create a critical path for the users to discover and use the solution offered by the Product.

2. We ask Clients to fill up our 'Quests Forms'. This form focuses on getting the primary information related to the project. We have separate quests for Android, iOS and Web applications. This gives us and also clients, a kick start to the project.

Here is [Android Quest](https://rainingclouds.typeform.com/to/ZolKsb) for reference. Also we get feedbacks from every of our client about these quests, and continuously update them. 

## Hangouts
In the first week, we have a hangout call everyday about project understanding, for around 30-40 mins. During this call we discuss about various aspects of the project like features, competitors, technical limitations, design patterns, UX etc. 

## Project Blueprint
Everything that we discuss during this period is basically ends up in a document that we call as project blueprint. This document keep on amending during the project.
