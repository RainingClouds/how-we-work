# Pricing Model

We offer either Time-N-Material to the clients.

### Time and Material Pricing Model

We price projects at a per person, per week rate. It is based on the time spent on the project in hours. We apply the hourly rate * total hours spent on by the developers on a sprint would be the payable amount for the client.
We raise the invoices at the end of the week and clients are expected to pay the invoices immediately. 

## NO Fixed Cost Model

With a Fixed-Price model, you build specification in the beginning, which means you are effectively making serious decisions when you have the least amount of information. You canâ€™t change (or it gets difficult / expensive to change) when you learn. We think accurate, long-term estimations are virtually impossible to make.

**Case Study**

We were working on an Android application for one of our client in Boston. Client was a technical one, and came up with a fixed set of features. They were very prepared, and seemed to have a clear understanding about the end picture. The task was to create something like Uber for buses. We were supposed to work on driver Android application and Rider applications on Android and iOS. 

As we were really impressed with the existing documentation made by the client about the project, we agreed to work on fixed cost model. But soon after the initial 2 sprints, it occurred that, we will need to add a feature of round trip booking. It was a relatively big change, and the deadline was of 1 month, but still we agreed onto incorporating the changes, as we were really excited to make this application, a great success. 

But this change was followed by a bunch of **"so called minute changes"**. We tried our best to convince them, as we ourselves have gone through MVP building for our own product. At the end client realized that the feature has become more of a pain, we ended up removing that feature in the final release. 

**Result**

We ended up wasting 2.5 weeks of development efforts.

**Moral of the story**

Nobody has 100% understanding about what they want.

***

Most of the fixed cost projects, have somewhat similar stories, so we have stopped taking up fixed cost projects.
