# Design Iteration

We divide the iteration into User Experience design and User Interface Design.

#User Experience Design
We kick-start the work by wire-framing user flows, navigation patterns and organizing content within the app. It helps us to get an overview of the system. We work with latest design principles provided by the platforms like Material design and Skeuomorphic design.

We ask the clients to share actual content instead of using lorem ipsum, it helps to get much closer feel while designing the product.

We use [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com/)to create prototype and share it with Client. Clients would get to see the interactive flow of the app and share the feedback asap.

#User Interface Design
We decide color pallet for different components inside the system. As per clients choice of pallet, we prepare multiple versions of few set of screens. Once client approves to go with specific color pallet. We start to design entire app.

Once all the designs are approved we prepare a 'Design Document', which gives a single place to see all the finalized designs/flow etc.

We always work on designs first, Get it approved and then go after development of it. Change in design while developing the app becomes hassel for developer.
