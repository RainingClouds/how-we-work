# Appointing Technology Owner

Technology owner is necessarily a full-stack developer and a good product manager. Now there are two things we have put, one is full-stack developer. 

When we say full-stack developer then we mean that, the person has deployed at least one project live, where he has been the lead developer for either of web application, web front end, html, mobile application development. 

Secondly product manager, which means he has successfully delivered at least one project on his own or has worked on minimum 5 projects as a developer inside RainingClouds.
