# Team Building

Once we have finalized the set of technologies, we setup a team for the project.

We have learnt that, distributed ownership usually end up in a lot of confusion. So we have formed a team structure that really works.

We have a **Project Owner**, who is a single point of contact for client about anything from technical issues, product road map, feature releases and monetary issues. He will make sure that all the glitches are settled down as soon as possible.

Then we have a **Technology Owner**, who owns the entire technology related decisions.

**Designer** who manages all user experience and interaction design of the product. He creates the required design assets and share with developers for further development. 

**Developers** are those, who actually code and **Testers** tests the applications for quality assurance.
