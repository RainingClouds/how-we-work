# Technology Selection Brainstorming
Usually clients come up with certain set of technologies in their mind. But sometimes they are really not fit for the product that we are developing. So we usually come up with an altered set of tools and technologies that we think are perfect for the gener of the product and obviously with detailed reasoning of the choices. **We aim to finish up this phase in maximum 2 weeks**

**Case study : Kabzz**

For example, Kabzz, one of the product that we have developed. Client had LAMP stack in mind, but we came with the most recent and powerful stack. Kabzz team was amazingly responsive and agreed onto the stack we suggested. And we ended up using **GoLang at the web end along with RabbitMq, PostgresSQL, Redis**.
