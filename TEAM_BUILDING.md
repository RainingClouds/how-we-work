# Team Building

Once we have finalized the set of technologies, we setup team for the project.

We have learnt that, distributed ownership usually end up in a lot of confusion. So we have formed a team structure that really works !!

So we have a **Project Owner**, who is a single point of contact for client about anything from technical issues to monetary issues. He will make sure that all the glitches are settled down as soon as possible.

Then we have a **Technology Owner**, who owns the entire technology related decisions.

**Designer** who manages all the designing related things. Usually he is not involved in the project for the whole duration. 

**Developers** are those, who actually code and **Testers** tests the applications for quality assurance.
