# Project Understanding

This is a very important step for us. This is the time when we are in clients shoes and trying to grasp all the possible thoughts, ideas client has about the product. 

## Quests
So we have a couple of forms that we make you fill up before starting the project. This form focuses on getting the primary information related to the project. We have separate quests for Android, iOS and web applications. This gives us and also clients, a kick start to the project.

Here is [Android Quest](https://rainingclouds.typeform.com/to/ZolKsb) for reference. Also we get feedbacks from every of our client about these quests, and continuously update them. 

## Hangouts
In the first week, we have an hangout call everyday about project understanding, for around 30-40 mins. During this call we discuss about various aspects of the project like features, competitors, technical limitations, design patterns, UX etc. 

## Project Blueprint
Everything that we discuss during this period is basically ends up in a document that we call as project blueprint. This document keep on amending during the project.
