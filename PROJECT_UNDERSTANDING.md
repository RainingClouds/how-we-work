# Project Understanding

This is a very important step for us. This is the time when we are in clients shoes and trying to grasp all the possible thoughts, ideas client has about the product. 

## Quests
So we have a couple of forms that we make you fill up before starting the project. This form focuses on getting the primary information related to the project. We have separate quests for Android, iOS and web applications. This gives us and also clients, a kick start to the project.
