#Introduction

This e-book is basically the articulation of the culture and code of conduct that we follow inside [RainingClouds](http://rainingclouds.com). This is written and maintained to train everybody who's coming inside the company as well as for the potential customers who want to know about [RainingClouds](http://rainingclouds.com).

Being a startup and having a product background ([AppSurfer](http://appsurfer.com) is our first product) we are trained for creating MVPs (Minimum Viable Product) and getting early feedbacks to settle down onto the final paths. But when We started services in 2014, we realized that along with pace, **processes** matters a lot when you are working with clients. And since then we have been amending this document for setting up a painless and an effective processes which are suitable for developers as well as the clients. 

One of the biggest odds we faced during following already defined processes were

1. Some of the things were overhead for developers
2. They were a bit complicated for non technical clients, so sometimes they are really not able to track the exact progress of the project.
3. Distributed ownership becomes problem in some cases (that's what we have learned)

But that doesn't mean that existing practices are not good, but we wanted flavor of something which is not an overhead for developers and also easily understandable for non-technical clients and making daily standups less painful.

One of the more important aspect of "How We Work" is the involvement of the client into daily work. But we have taken care that, this doesn't overwhelm client at any point. Client become the core of everything that we do while working on the project, having said that, one of our team member working closely with client for taking decisions. He becomes the single point of contact and bridge between client and [RainingClouds](http://rainingclouds.com). 

We evaluate the processes every quarter. We tighten up the processes that work for us and tweak the onces which are causing issues for us.
