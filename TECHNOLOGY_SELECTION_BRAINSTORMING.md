# Technology Selection Brainstorming
Usually clients come up with certain set of technologies in their mind. But sometimes they are really not fit for the product that we are developing. So we usually come up with an altered set of tools and technologies that we think are perfect for the gener of the product and obviously with detailed reasoning of the choices. We aim to finish up this phase in maximum 2 weeks.
