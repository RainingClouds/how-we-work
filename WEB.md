# Web
There are various parameters for landing upon a particular set of technology for web applications. **Time constraints**, **client preferences**, **ready made pluggins in the project domain**, **existing competitors technology preferences and their experience**,**our preferences and experience** are a few if them.

If using some framework, or technology is must for a project, and if we don't have the expertise in it, we actually invest time and money to learn that, to make sure we use the best available technology for the current project.

We maintain a technology battlefield, which is basically a list of technologies, that we think, are going to be dominant, and we start learning those. 

## Our expertise for web applications
### Golang
We love Golang, every bit of it. And we are one of the early adopters of Golang for web applications as well. Till date (Feb 2015), we have written in all, 5 web applications in Golang, and using different frameworks.

**Advantages:**

1. Go compiles very quickly.
2. Go supports concurrency at the language level.
3. Functions are first class objects in Go.
4. Go has garbage collection.
5. Strings and maps are built into the language.

**Disadvantages:**

1. Go is still an experimental language subject to change. (I suppose this could be an advantage depending on how you look at it. For most it's probably a disadvantage.)
2. Go's not very usable on Windows yet.
3. The packages distributed with Go are pretty useful, but there are still some libraries you'll miss. Most notably a UI toolkit.
4. There is no support for generics in Go, although there are many discussions around it.


### Scala
### Java 1.8
