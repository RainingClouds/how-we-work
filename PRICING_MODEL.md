# Pricing Model

We offer Time-N-Material model to the clients.

### Time and Material Pricing Model

We price projects at a per person, per week rate. It is based on the time spent on the project in hours. We apply the hourly rate * total hours spent on by the developers on a sprint would be the payable amount for the client.
We raise the invoices at the end of the week and clients are expected to pay the invoices immediately. 

## NO Fixed Cost Model

With a Fixed-Price model, you build specification in the beginning, which means you are effectively making serious decisions when you have the least amount of information. You canâ€™t change (or it gets difficult / expensive to change) when you learn. We think accurate, long-term estimations are virtually impossible to make.
