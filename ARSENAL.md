To make processes better, selecting better tools is of utmost importance. We have carefully evaluated different tools over the period of 3 years, to completed our suit of tools that we use for a project.

## Project Management Tools
Project management is mainly focused on the communication between the client and RainingClouds. So we have chosen the most generic tool called "Basecamp".

Basecamp is the place where all the asynchronous discussions will happen. So if anyone has to sync up with the latest development of the project, Basecamp will be the starting point of it.

Along with the normal discussions, we push out the weekly reviews of each project, that covers the overall progress made in that week, the problems we have faced, new things introduced and the stories that we are taking up for the next week. This will be created as a new discussion on Basecamp, and all the comments will be considered in amendment of the plan.
